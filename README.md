## Introduction
Inspired by the friendly Baymax, “Are you satisfied with your care?”

Personal assistants lack in a mix of convenience and healthcare even with the ones currently present in the market. To bridge this gap, Mr.Blob; your very own healthcare assistant, is here!

This is an implementation of a RAG health chatbot leveraging chatgpt 3.5 turbo integrated with Pinecone vector database and LSTM model analysing heart rate data to detect anxiety levels, providing robust personalised health insights.
